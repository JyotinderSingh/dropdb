# DropDB 
## A simple, fully featured database written in Go.
This project is built as a personal exercise as I work my way through Edward Sciore's [Database Design and Implementation](https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-3-030-33836-7) book.

The database implements the following features:
- [x] Disk and File Management 
- [x] Memory Management
- [x] Transaction Management
- [x] Record Management 
- [ ] Metadata Management
- [ ] Query Processing
- [ ] Query Parsing
- [ ] Parsing
- [ ] Planning
- [ ] JDBC Interfaces
- [ ] Indexing
- [ ] Materialization and Sorting
- [ ] Effective Buffer Utilization
- [ ] Query Optimization

## Additional Features
- Support for multiple data types (int, short, long, string, bool, date)
- On-disk layout optimizations to ensure byte alignment and reduce padding.
